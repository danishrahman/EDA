📌 Project Overview:
For this project, I delved into a comprehensive analysis of tip behavior in restaurants. My goal was to uncover patterns and insights by examining the variations in tips across different days, times, and bill amounts. By applying statistical techniques and data visualization, I aimed to shed light on the factors that influence tipping habits.

🔍 Methodology:
I meticulously collected a diverse dataset from various restaurants, spanning a significant time period. The dataset captured key information, including the day of the week, time of the visit, and the corresponding bill amounts and tips. Leveraging this rich dataset, I conducted a rigorous exploration and analysis to gain meaningful insights into tipping behavior.
